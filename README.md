## Installation üß©

1) Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run build
PORT=7019 npm start
```

Open in Stremio: `http://localhost:7019/manifest.json`

2) Select countries (optional)

- Safe path: `http://localhost:7019/cfg-it-uk-fr/manifest.json`
- Exclusions: `http://localhost:7019/cfg-it-uk-fr-ex-de-pt/manifest.json`
- Query variant: `http://localhost:7019/manifest.json?include=it,uk&exclude=de`
